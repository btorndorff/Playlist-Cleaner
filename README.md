# playlist-cleaner
A python script that leverages the Spotify API to create a playlist cleaning session, a session that allows users to delete music by skipping the song that is playing.

I was inspired to make this script due to a large playlist I have of over 1,000 songs with many of them being songs I have lost interest in. The current method of deleting songs is not friendly towards large playlists so I created this script to make it easy to do so.
